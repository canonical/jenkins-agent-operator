description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Agent on machines and
  configurable to use a Jenkins charm deployed in another Juju model.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Jenkins Agent
  on VMs and bare matel.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  Agents whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to deploy on
  the platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Jenkins Agent simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.
